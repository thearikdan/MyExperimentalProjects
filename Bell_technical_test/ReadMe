The "rest_server.py" file is a Python-based Flask REST API server that offers two endpoint options for users:

The first endpoint, located at http://127.0.0.1:5000/hosts/<host_ip>/ten-riskiest-vulnerabilities, returns the 10 most critical vulnerabilities for a specific host.
The second endpoint, located at http://127.0.0.1:5000/hosts/<host_ip>/sorted-vulnerabilities/, returns all vulnerabilities for a specific host in alphabetical order.

Additionally, this endpoint supports pagination through the use of "page" and "limit" parameters in the API call, such as http://127.0.0.1:5000/hosts/<host_ip>/sorted-vulnerabilities/?page=2&limit=5

The <host_ip> value can be obtained from the "Source" column from the "vulnerabilities(fixed).csv" file.

The "test_rest_server.py" file provides a set of tests for the API using the "pytest" framework and can be executed by running the command "pytest" in the same directory.

This project also requires the installation of Flask, Pandas and Pytest packages in a virtual environment. The "requirements.txt" file is included to assist with installation of these packages.
